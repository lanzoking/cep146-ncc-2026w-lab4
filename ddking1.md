The difference with git merge and git hub pull request is the location. Git merge occurs locally and combines changes from one branch to another, no review, no discussion. Github pull requests allows others to the chance to review your code before merging, shows diffs, comments and approvals. This also run CI/CD checks, allows for discussions before merging then finally performs a merge under the hood of GitHub.
